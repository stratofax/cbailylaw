<h3 id="toc_13">In the press</h3>

<p>Commonwealth Magazine reported on an amicus brief submitted in the
matter <em>Mederi, Inc. v. City of Salem</em>, a
case before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><q>Christine Baily, an attorney for the Cannabis Control Commission &hellip;
notes the inconsistency in the law. Baily writes that by granting
municipalities exclusive control over the host community agreement
process, municipalities have authority over who can seek state
licensure.</q></p>
